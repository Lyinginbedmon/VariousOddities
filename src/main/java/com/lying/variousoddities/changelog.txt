Additions
	Creature types reimplemented, alter in the config to apply various pros and cons to mobs and specific players
	The /types command can list, define, add, remove, set, and even test for creature types in a diverse manner
	Mob factions reimplemented, allowing player-specific reputation-based behaviours from goblins & kobolds
	The /faction command can control the reputation of specific players as well as manage factions in the world and their relations with each-other
	Crabs and giant crabs have been reintroduced, with a bonus degree of musical talent
	Worgs and wargs have been partially reintroduced
	Ghastlings now spawn when ghast are killed by their own fireballs, and can be tamed using most sweet foods

Known bugs
	Boundary line rendering of settlement rooms is very glitchy, especially when not viewed in first person (stable when viewed first person w/ HUD off)
	No mob sounds in multiplayer (inconsistent)

Changes
	Default spawn settings adjusted, overall more even mixes of vanilla mobs and oddities
	Creature types now include a few new types with their own features and more smoothly affect drowning, starving, and sleeping (Players that can't sleep do not spawn phantoms)
	Fixed an inconsistent bug related to goblins taking damage
