Known bugs
	Boundary line rendering of settlement rooms is very glitchy, especially when not viewed in first person (stable when viewed first person w/ HUD off)
	No mob sounds in multiplayer (inconsistent)

Changes
	Default spawn settings adjusted, overall more even mixes of vanilla mobs and oddities

	Goblins are now persistent creatures
	Commands changed to require operator status
	Drafting tables can now be used to fully define a new room for a settlement, use "/settlement room <index or name> add" to add a finalised room to an existing settlement
