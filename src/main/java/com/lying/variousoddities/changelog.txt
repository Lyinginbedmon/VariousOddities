Additions
	Creature types reimplemented, alter in the config to apply various pros and cons to mobs and specific players
	The /types command can list, define, add, remove, set, and even test for creature types in a diverse manner
	Mob factions partially reimplemented, don't expect much from these just yet though

Known bugs
	Boundary line rendering of settlement rooms is very glitchy, especially when not viewed in first person (stable when viewed first person w/ HUD off)
	No mob sounds in multiplayer (inconsistent)

Changes
	Default spawn settings adjusted, overall more even mixes of vanilla mobs and oddities
	Creature types now include a few new types with their own features and more smoothly affect drowning, starving, and sleeping (Players that can't sleep do not spawn phantoms)
	Fixed an inconsistent bug related to goblins taking damage
